        <div class="boardMemberName">Scott Lukens</div>
        <div class="boardMemberDesc">
          The natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities of the Pacific Northwest compelled Scott to relocate to Vancouver, WA in the mid-1980s. Hiking, mountain biking, XC skiing and travel remain some of his major pastimes. Along the way, Scott helped parent and raise two daughters, both of whom now regularly provide training and learning opportunities. </br></br>

      Scott credits his dad, Ned, for his interest and passion for racial justice. Ned was a disc jockey at a black-owned R&B station in Atlanta, GA for more than twenty years. He modeled equal treatment for all people every day of his life. </br></br>

      Scott has served on a few non-profit boards over the years, including Portland Audubon Society, Friends of Trees, Tears of Joy Theatre, and Tualatin Riverkeepers.

Shaun continued practice until October 2016 when she became the Executive Director of the Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (OCDLA). Shaun has taught trial skills at the University of Oregon School of Law, at OCDLA’s Trial Skills College and continues to lecture on trial skills and criminal defense topics. </br></br>
      
      Shaun is a past president of OCDLA, served five years as a director of the National Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (NACDL), served as the Ninth Circuit Representative to Defender Services Advisory Group (DSAG) 1999-2008 and as the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) Representative for the District of Oregon (1997-2008). In 2016 Super Lawyers named Shaun in the top 25 women lawyers in Oregon and in 2018 she received the James M. Burns award in criminal law from the Oregon Chapter of the Federal Bar Association.
