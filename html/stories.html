        <div class="boardMemberDesc">
          Mr. R struggled with his metal health and violated a restraining order during a difficult period. Although he had regularly scheduled mental health appointments through a local organization, he was not always able to make his appointments due to lack of transportation. We provided his attorney funding for a bus pass so that transportation issues would no longer keep him from accessing the treatment he needed to maintain stability.

        <div class="boardMemberDesc">
          Ms. K, a mentally ill person, was deemed not competent to proceed with her case, and the court ordered that she be transferred to a mental health treatment facility. Due to the limited space at the facility, Ms. K had to wait in the jail for months before she could be admitted. Ms. K was often distraught and confused about why she was in jail. She told her attorney that she wasn’t getting enough to eat, and that she didn’t have money on her books to call her loved ones. Her attorney applied for $50 for Ms. K’s jail “books,” and Ms. K’s mood improved, making her jail stay a bit more bearable until she could be admitted to the treatment facility.

        <div class="boardMemberDesc">
          Mr. B had never been charged with a crime before, and he was worried about keeping his record clean. Although he had a good case for trial, when the DA offered a diversion – the opportunity to participate in a restorative justice program in exchange for a dismissal of the case – Mr. B. agreed. However, there was also a financial element – Mr. B. would have to pay a $100 fee before the dismissal would take effect. Mr. B was could not afford the fee, so his attorney applied for funding to cover that cost and ensure that Mr. B could complete his diversion.
